
What's finished:
You can access this api, and currently it predicts upcoming UFC events using linear regression. I gather data through a webscrapper.
To receive a list of all predicted winners for the next fight, you can access the endpoint at
http://3.134.85.95/api/winners

An example command could be:
curl -i http://3.134.85.95:8008/api/winners
You can access a front end of the api through
http://3.134.85.95/web/front

Or use the requests module in python to open a request.
Currently there is only one endpoint.

What I want completed:
A site where users can see the upcoming UFC fight, and the site - server, whatever, will
give the users a fight prediction for that fight. 
TODO:
More routes for the api.
	-More routes include
		1. Search 2 fighters and predict who would win between  difficulty 6
		2. Return a JSON of bouts based on a query 		difficulty 4
	-Essentially, this is an API for an SQL, however instead of letting users to directly interact with my DB, they can only pull data.
	-The only thing that will interact with my DB are the autonomous scripts located on the server.

make the rotating proxy better... probably make another webscraper for that hahahah

Make it multithreaded.
Make it distributed (for fun).

Do front end.


Currently:
I'm still in school, and this is a busy quarter. However this is a project I want to complete by,
this quarter so I'll try to give weekly updates. Working on a distributed systems project as well as
an android video game.
